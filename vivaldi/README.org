* Vivaldi customization
This folder contains a custom css to hide the menu bar of Vivaldi. To use a browser in a tiling window manager, this is way better to disable this menu.

Unfortunatly, to apply it you need the following manual steps:

- In vivaldi's address bar, type: vivaldi://experiments/
- Check the `Allow for using CSS modifications` option
- Type `CTRL+F12` to go in the settings
- In the `Apearance` tab, select the css file in `CUSTOM UI MODIFICATIONS` section

* Extensions
I use the following extensions:
- Dark reader mode
- Surfing keys
- Tab-less (a must in a tiling wm)
