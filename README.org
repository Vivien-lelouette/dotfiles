* Dotfiles
This repo contains all of my configurations. It is a work in progress.
This is managed using GNU stow to manage symlink creation.

Most of this configuration is base on the excellent [[https://youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters][System Crafters livestreams]]. 
I highly recommand his channel as it was a great help moving from Doom emacs to a clean Emacs from scratch. 
His [[https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles][dotfiles repo]] is also a great source for Emacs tips !
 
* Global prerequisite
*** GNU Stow
This allows us to easily manage symlinks of our configurations to our home folder.
Each subfolders of this repo Will be symlinked at your home folder as long as this repo is cloned in your home folder. 

To created Ã  module symlinks, just start the following command in the dotfile folder: 

#+begin_src shell

  stow $NAME_OF_FOLDER.

#+end_src

Stow also supports regex, so to create every symlinks: 

#+begin_src shell

  stow *

#+end_src

To install stow on Ubuntu, use the following command:

#+begin_src shell :tangle global/.scripts/init-ubuntu.sh :shebang #!/bin/sh :mkdirp yes

  sudo apt install stow

#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :tangle global/.scripts/init-ubuntu.sh :mkdirp yes

  for script in $(find ~/.scripts/*/ -name init-ubuntu.sh) ; do sh $script ; done

#+begin_src shell :tangle global/.scripts/install-all-tools.sh :shebang #!/bin/sh :mkdirp yes
