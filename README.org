* Dotfiles

This repo contains all of my confiurations. It is a work in progress.
This is managed using GNU stow to manage symlink creation.

* Installing Emacs from sources

The snippets below will install emacs from their git master:

#+begin_src shell

  git clone -b master git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
  sudo apt install autoconf make gcc texinfo libgtk-3-dev libxpm-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev libtiff5-dev libgnutls28-dev libncurses5-dev
  cd emacs
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-modules
  make
  sudo make install

#+end_src
